# Breezy - A Weather App

## Live Demo: https://jtcaovan.github.io/WeatherApp/

## Description
A simple weather widget-style application that displays the current weather and hourly/daily forecast. 

## Learning Outcomes
This was a previous project rebuilt using React for additional practice.

* Learning outcomes include: 
    * Asynchonous Javascript (Promises/async/await)
    * Built with React
        * React form handling (using react-form-hooks library)
        * Conditional rendering
        * Handling react events
    * Working with APIs
    * Styling with Tailwind CSS

## Tools and Technologies
* JavaScript
* React.js
* Tailwind CSS
* OpenWeather API

## Features
* Weather information from any city in the world
* Simple loading animation when fetching new location
* Convert between C°/F°
* Responsive web design

## Challenges
* Project structure organization - splitting code into reusable React components
* Styling UI for responsive and clean design
* Accessing specific weather data from API calls - some OpenWeather calls didn't have all the weather information needed for this application
* Date and Time Unix conversions
